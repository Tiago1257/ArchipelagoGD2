## This is not in a playable state! Contributions are welcome!

This is a currently unofficial and unfinished mod that adds support for Geometry Dash in the [Archipelago MultiWorld Randomizer](https://archipelago.gg/).

It uses a (currently outdated) [fork](https://github.com/Tiago1257/APCpp-gd) of N00byKing's [APCpp](https://github.com/N00byKing/APCpp) which switches to static linking, for better use with the Geode SDK.

The also unfinished and very broken code for the .apworld can be found [here](https://github.com/Tiago1257/Archipelago).
